<p>
The rule of thirds is a guideline that proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal 
lines and two equally spaced vertical linesThe vital info on the banner and the man holding the shirt on the banner are placed along these lines or their intersections.

    <h3>GAIA</h3>
    <a href="https://www.gaia.com/?render=pg-ab-v1" ><img src="images/gaia_foto.jpeg" alt="Andrea_foto"></a>
    
    <p>
    This section is almost at the end of the home page where we find a brief video explaining what Gai is and what has to offer. Below it, there are three plans
    arrange from cheapest to highest. As a potential buyer I find this seccion pleasing to watch because it catches first my attention with the large element
    and then presents oderly the different plans I could buy. The colors combine with one another making everything easier and quicker to read.
